Text: 

Our cases consist of three different types of media, Edgenotes, podcast and interactive learning exercises, to accompany the core text to appeal to different types of learning styles.  The student can choose the level of detail they want to discover about a particular topic.  The result is an engaged student equipped with practical skills for the remainder of their education experience and beyond.

Inspiration for a case may come from a current or past event or a published work. Each case is presented with the following components: main text, multi-media Edgenotes, podcast, learning exercises, and teaching guide. In addition, each case is designed to be accessible, meaning that they are design for different screen sizes, fit into different class timelines and disciplines.

The result is an engaged student equipped with practical skills for the remainder of their education experience and beyond.

Description: 

MSCs consist of three elements: Edgenotes, podcast and interactive learning exercises, to accompany the core text to appeal to different types of learning styles. Students can choose the level of detail they want to discover about a particular topic and decide how they want to engage with different elements. 

MSCs translate the real experiences of key ‘decisions makers’ through a digital platform to support face to face learning, an engagement experience that is lost in academic journal articles. These cases are “living” modules, which allow them to continually evolve and be updated, based on input from those working with the case.
