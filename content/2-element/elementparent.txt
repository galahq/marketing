Title: Elements

----

Tagline: Accompanying traditional case text are elements that excite and engage.

----

Text: 

Our cases consist of three different types of media, Edgenotes, podcast and interactive learning exercises, to accompany the core text to appeal to different types of learning styles.  The student can choose the level of detail they want to discover about a particular topic.  The result is an engaged student equipped with practical skills for the remainder of their education experience and beyond.

Inspiration for a case may come from a current or past event or a published work. Each case is presented with the following components: main text, multi-media Edgenotes, podcast, learning exercises, and teaching guide. In addition, each case is designed to be accessible, meaning that they are design for different screen sizes, fit into different class timelines and disciplines.

where you depart: from often still solely text-based, sender (teacher) - receiver (student), or input (lecture) - output (test) models. Maybe you could add that excursions and summer travel programs abroad are also potential ways of an interactive learning experience.
