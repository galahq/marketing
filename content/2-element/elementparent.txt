Our cases consist of three different types of media, Edgenotes, podcast and interactive learning exercises, to accompany the core text to appeal to different types of learning styles.  The student can choose the level of detail they want to discover about a particular topic.  The result is an engaged student equipped with practical skills for the remainder of their education experience and beyond.

Inspiration for a case may come from a current or past event or a published work. Each case is presented with the following components: main text, multi-media Edgenotes, podcast, learning exercises, and teaching guide. In addition, each case is designed to be accessible, meaning that they are design for different screen sizes, fit into different class timelines and disciplines.

The result is an engaged student equipped with practical skills for the remainder of their education experience and beyond.

Description: 

MSCs present actual experiences or experiences inspired by real circumstances of key ‘decisions makers’ through a digital platform. Academic articles can be dry. MSCs represent a more immersive experience in what we consider to be “living” stories that evolve and continue to be updated based on input from anyone who takes an interest in the case.

MSCs contain three elements to accompany the core text: Edgenotes, podcast and interactive learning exercises. These elements appeal to different learning styles. Students decide the level of detail and how they want to engage with a topic.
