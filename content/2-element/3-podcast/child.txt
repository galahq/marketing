MSC podcasts are radio segments produced by case authors in collaboration with University of Michigan’s student run radio station WCBN FM. They are conversations that expose students to a different side of the issue . Podcasts are interviews with the case decision maker(s) and/or relevant experts. Insiders' perspectives. 

Additionally, MSC podcasts are an opportunity to untangle case narratives and assumptions, discuss and develop potential solutions with the case’s decision maker, and shed light on underexplored aspects of the case material. Presenting the material in the form of a lively conversation likely leads to increase learning outcomes relative to lectures, and presently, this hypothesis is being tested in the classroom.

###An MSC podcast can be:
a discussion about the background of the case
a conversation about key concepts or methods
a dialogue that untangles challenges and assumptions
a debate over objectives and tradeoffs

### Examples
**Unpacking complex issues**
	Can Green Mountain and Tesla solve the “peak problem”?  Energy storage is popularly assumed to be a ‘green’ technology.  We hear firsthand from a company implementing household storage and learn why the ‘greenness’ of storage is more complicated than it appears. 

**Critiquing dominant narratives**
	Urban farming organizations aim to improve food access in Detroit.  We hear from a board member of one organization, about the challenges and opportunities of running an all-volunteer farm, while two activists and organizers explain the need for Detroiters to be a part of the conversation. 

**Expanding the conversation**
	Should we hunt gray wolves in Michigan? The ‘Wolf Wars’ podcast takes this conversation beyond State borders, exploring human-wildlife conflicts in India and Yellowstone National Park, and the narratives that shape them.

###Participants
Case authors, experts, practitioners, decision-maker,  stakeholders

###Format
Free form, conversation driven

###Length
Thirty minutes to an hour.
