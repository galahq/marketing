Text: 

Edgenotes are jumping-off points for deeper exploration. Different than footnotes, each Edgenote correspond to a specific part of the case and are presented right alongside the text. You get to control your pace and way of exploring the edgenotes – you can review the edgenotes along reading the case; you can also choose to review all the edgenotes at the end from the Edgenote gallery. Complementary to the classic case narrative, we’re curating multimedia content which provide context, detail, and opportunities for further investigation. Through these “Edgenotes,” students are able to shape their individual learning experience as they explore the case material.
