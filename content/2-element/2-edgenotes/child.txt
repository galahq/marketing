Subdescription: Edgenotes are audiovisual materials that *complement*, rather than supplement the case content. They are jumping-off points for deeper exploration. Curated from audiovisual resources, Edgenotes offer insights into organizational and ecological histories, expert perspectives, core concepts and theories, and different voices around the case.

##Some heading
#####Curation
###Careful selecting the most relevant segments will from larger compositions. 
For example, we may extract a critical two-minute segment from a 16-minute video, or a 1-page excerpt from a 40-page technical report. This careful curation allows students only engage with the most relevant part of the larger piece, but also give students the option to explore more if they are interested in deeper exploration with a specific Edgenote.

#####Position
###Closely tied to narrative
Rejecting the traditional footnote, Edgenotes are presented right alongside the corresponding text. Learners control their own pace and way of exploring. They can visit Edgenotes along the way or wait to the end and explore them all at once in the Edgenote gallery.
