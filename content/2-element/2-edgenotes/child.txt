Text: 

Edgenotes are jumping-off points for deeper exploration. Video and audio bites, articles, reports, newspaper clips, social media posts, and maps—all contribute to a richer learning experience. At MSC, we curate multimedia content to provide greater context, detail, and opportunities for further investigation. Through “Edgenotes,” students are able to shape their individual learning experiences as they explore the case material.

1. ###Carefully curated content
We may extract a critical two-minute segment from a 16-minute video, or a 1-page excerpt from a 40-page technical report. Thoughtful curation helps students quickly identify the most relevant pieces of information, but also provides the option to explore further if they are inspired by a specific Edgenote.

2. ###Closely tied to narrative
Rejecting the traditional footnote, Edgenotes are presented right alongside the corresponding text. Learners control their own pace and way of exploring. They can visit Edgenotes along the way or wait until the end and explore them all at once in the Edgenote gallery.

Subdescription: Edgenotes are audiovisual materials that *complement*, rather than supplement the case content. They are jumping-off points for deeper exploration. Curated from audiovisual resources, Edgenotes offer insights into organizational and ecological histories, expert perspectives, core concepts and theories, and different voices around the case.

Sample our Edgenotes and begin to explore:
<div class="gala-embedded-card">
<h3>Background and context of the sustainability challenge</h3>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.learnmsc.org/cases/mi-wolves#/">Michigan Wolf Wars case</a>, a <a data-edgenote="michigan">detailed map of the region</a> displays the area where the challenge is unfolding. </p>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.learnmsc.org/cases/indonesia-conservation#/">Indonesia Conservation Funding case</a>, a video displays the <a data-edgenote="unrivaled-biodiversity">spectacular behaviors of sharks and their importance to local biodiversity</a>. </p>
</div>

<div class="gala-embedded-card">
<h3>Detailed data about the region</h3>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.learnmsc.org/cases/baltimore-smart-meters#/">Baltimore smart meters case</a>, explore infographics, charts, and reports to understand potential costs of the proposed bill. Manipulate an <a data-edgenote="bill-impacts">interactive map</a> to reveal specific energy burdens that could result. </p>
<p>In other Edgenotes, discover specific costs incurred at different sites of a proposed area by examining infographics, charts, and reports.</p>
</div>

<div class="gala-embedded-card">
<h3>Stakeholder perspectives</h3>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.learnmsc.org/cases/mi-wolves#/">Wolf Wars case</a>, <a data-edgenote="a-heated-debate"> videos give voice to the conflicting perspectives </a> of stakeholders like residents, environmentalists, and hunters. </p>

<p>In the same case, a news article discusses <a data-edgenote="hunting-conservation-economics">particular concerns around conservation and economics.</a> </p>
</div>

<div class="gala-embedded-card">
<h3>Digestible concepts</h3>
In the <a href="http://www.learnmsc.org/cases/ethiopia-napa#/">Ethiopia case</a>, learn how to do <a data-edgenote="basics-of-cba">cost-benefit analysis with an explanatory video</a>. 
</div>
<div class="gala-embedded-card">
