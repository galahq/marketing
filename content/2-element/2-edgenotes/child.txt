Text: 

Edgenotes are jumping-off points for deeper exploration. Video and audio bites, articles, reports, newspaper clips, social media posts, and maps - all contribute to a richer learning experience. At MSC, we curate multimedia content to provide greater context, detail, and opportunities for further investigation. Through “Edgenotes,” students are able to shape their individual learning experiences as they explore the case material.

1. ###Carefully curated content
We may extract a critical two-minute segment from a 16-minute video, or a 1-page excerpt from a 40-page technical report. Thoughtful curation helps students quickly identify the most relevant pieces of information, but also provides the option to explore further if they are inspired by a specific Edgenote.

2. ###Closely tied to narrative
Rejecting the traditional footnote, Edgenotes are presented right alongside the corresponding text. Learners control their own pace and way of exploring. They can visit Edgenotes along the way or wait until the end and explore them all at once in the Edgenote gallery.

Subdescription: Edgenotes are audiovisual materials that *complement*, rather than supplement the case content. They are jumping-off points for deeper exploration. Curated from audiovisual resources, Edgenotes offer insights into organizational and ecological histories, expert perspectives, core concepts and theories, and different voices around the case.

Sample our Edgenotes to see how they help you explore:
<div class="gala-embedded-card">
<h3>Background and context of the decision</h3>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.learnmsc.org/cases/mi-wolves#/">wolf hunt case</a>, see a <a data-edgenote="michigan">detailed map of the region</a> where the decision is taking place. </p>
<p>And in the <a href="http://www.learnmsc.org/cases/indonesia-conservation#/">Indonesia conservation finance case</a>, get introduced to the <a data-edgenote="unrivaled-biodiversity">unrivaled biodiversity behaviors of sharks</a>. </p>
</div>

<div class="gala-embedded-card">
<h3>Detailed data about the region</h3>
<p>In the <a href="">Baltimore smart meters case</a>, manipulate an <a data-edgenote="bill-impacts">interactive map</a> to reveal specific energy burdens that could be imposed by the proposed bill. </p>
<p>In other Edgenotes, discover specific costs incurred at different sites of a proposed area by examining infographics, charts, and reports.</p>
</div>

<div class="gala-embedded-card">
<h3>Stakeholder perspectives</h3>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.learnmsc.org/cases/mi-wolves#/">wolf hunt case</a>, view videos from different stakeholders, including residents, environmentalists, and hunters. To show the heated debate, one of these videos <a data-edgenote="a-heated-debate">captures interviews offering different points of view</a>. </p>
<p>In the same case, read an article that discusses <a data-edgenote="hunting-conservation-economics">particular concerns around conservation and economics</a>. Also, dive deeper into the reasons behind different perspectives using the Edgenotes that link you to relevant reports put out by an organization. </p>
</div>

<div class="gala-embedded-card">
<h3>Digestible concepts</h3>
In the <a href="">Ethiopia case</a>, learn how to do <a data-edgenote="basics-of-cba">cost-benefit analysis with an explanatory video</a>. 
</div>
<div class="gala-embedded-card">
While in the <a href="">Baltimore smart meters case</a>, quickly grasp <a data-edgenote="electricity-generation-transmission-and-distribution">the difference between electricity generation, transmission, and distribution across the grid from an audio clip</a>.
