Text: 

Edgenotes are jumping-off points for deeper exploration. Video and audio bites, articles, reports, newspaper clips, social media posts, and maps- all contribute to a richer learning experience. At MSC, we curate multimedia content to provide greater context, detail and opportunities for further investigation. Through “Edgenotes,” students are able to shape their individual learning experience as they explore the case material.

1. ###Carefully curated content
We may extract a critical two-minute segment from a 16-minute video, or a 1-page excerpt from a 40-page technical report. This thoughtful curation helps students quickly identify the most relevant pieces of information, but also gives them the option to explore further if they are inspired by a specific Edgenote.

2. ###Closely tied to narrative
Rejecting the traditional footnote, Edgenotes are presented right alongside the corresponding text. Learners control their own pace and way of exploring. They can visit Edgenotes along the way or wait to the end and explore them all at once in the Edgenote gallery.

Subdescription: Edgenotes are audiovisual materials that *complement*, rather than supplement the case content. They are jumping-off points for deeper exploration. Curated from audiovisual resources, Edgenotes offer insights into organizational and ecological histories, expert perspectives, core concepts and theories, and different voices around the case.
