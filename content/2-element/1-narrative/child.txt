Text: 

At heart, our cases are stories. Many draw from practitioners’ own experiences. They begin with a decision maker and center around a problem that needs to be solved. The cases introduce different sets of interests, present options and tradeoffs, and ask students to make a choice. In this way, a successful case can guide students to an inductive understanding of how sustainability problems can be approached. 

##Our stories are wide-ranging, traversing an array of:
1. ###Topics
MSC authors represent a variety of disciplines interested in diverse topics.
2. ###Sectors
MSCs engage with public, private, non-profit, and other sectors.
3. ###Scales and locations
MSCs occur at multiple scales and locations, ranging from global to national and subnational, pre to post industrial, and rural to urban.

Subdescription: Each MSC tells the story of a real-world problem with a challenging decision. A standard MSC is composed of a clear narrative leading to the problem, one or more decision points, and several potential responses. As the problem unfolds, key decision makers and stakeholders are introduced, alongside their stakes and tradeoffs.
