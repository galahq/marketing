At the heart, our cases are stories. Many draw from practitioners’ own experiences. They begin with a decision maker and center around a problem that needs to be solved. The cases introduce different sets of interests, present options and tradeoffs, and ask students to make a choice. In this way, a successful case can guide students to an inductive understanding of how sustainability problems can be approached.
