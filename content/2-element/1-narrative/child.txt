At the heart of it, our cases are stories: they begin with a decision maker and center around a problem that need to be solved. The cases introduce different sets of interests, present options and tradeoffs, and ask students to make a choice. In this way, a successful case can guide students to an inductive understanding of the core competencies of the field.

Many of these cases are created from practitioners experiences in the field.  Situations that can be lost in academic articles but are sometimes more valuable than the dry data from research.
