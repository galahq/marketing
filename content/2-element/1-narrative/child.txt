At the heart, our cases are stories. Many draw from practitioners’ own experiences. They begin with a decision maker and center around a problem that needs to be solved. The cases introduce different sets of interests, present options and tradeoffs, and ask students to make a choice. In this way, a successful case can guide students to an inductive understanding of how sustainability problems can be approached. 

##Our stories are wide-ranging, traversing an array of:
1. ###Topics
MSC authors represent a variety of disciplines interested in diverse topics.
2. ###Sectors
MSCs engage with public, private, non-profit, and other sectors.
3. ###Scales and locations
MSCs emerge from multiple scales and locations, ranging from global, national and subnational, pre to post industrial, rural to urban.
