Description: 

Michigan Sustainability Cases (MSC), funded by a Transforming Learning in the Third Century initiative, is building a case-based curriculum for sustainability education in a variety of professional schools. MSC is writing and piloting initial cases throughout the U-M campus ranging from its current home in the SNRE  to Engineering, Social Work, and beyond.
The MSC initiative is focused on developing a series of cases that will be presented via the MSC online platform, which encourages student interaction with the case material. As with the traditional case method, MSCs present the student with the case, the decision maker, and various stakeholders, allowing the student to analyze priorities and tradeoffs in reaching a recommendation. Unlike the traditional case method, each MSC is accompanied by two additional “tentpole” components (multimedia “Edgenotes” and an hour-long podcast),  which together serve to bring greater depth to the case content.  Through the seamless incorporation of diverse  audiovisual sources and in-depth interviews with real world decision makers, MSCs provide a more immersive and nuanced educational approach to sustainability and environmental decision making.
Besides MSCs campus-wide influence, we expect to have a worldwide impact by building global partners and hosting the global case competition.

##Initiative
Michigan Sustainability Cases (MSC), funded by a Transforming Learning in the Third Century initiative, is building a case-based curriculum for sustainability education in a variety of professional schools. MSC is writing and piloting initial cases throughout the U-M campus ranging from its current home in the SNRE  to Engineering, Social Work, and beyond.

The MSC initiative is focused on developing a series of cases that will be presented via the MSC online platform, which encourages student interaction with the case material. 

Besides MSCs campus-wide influence, we expect to have a worldwide impact by building global partners and hosting the global case competition.

##Goal
Our goal is to transform sustainability learning by transforming our teaching method. The overarching framework is to help students achieve sustainability competencies including: systems-thinking, anticipatory, normative, strategic, and interpersonal (As defined in Arnim Wiek, Lauren Withycombe, and Carles L. Redman, 2011, Key competencies in sustainability: a reference framework for academic program development, Sustain Sci, 6:203-218). These are skills that will help develop students towards their full potential — becoming future sustainability leaders. Beyond molding leaders in sustainability, success for us would be: students with higher material retention than that from a more traditional lecture experience, and a more engaged learning experience for which we would have statistics and analytics about time spent with complementary material.

##Expected Impact
MSC is going have an impact on sustainability education from the U-M campus specifically to interested students around the world.

MSC is going to transform sustainability learning on campus to be more case-based, engaging, and participatory. It is also going to facilitate a campus wide sustainability learning community with more resources and support for students who are interested in the ever-growing sustainability field.

With some 50 individual case studies made publically accessible, we hope to capture the attention of pre-college and current students around the world with the intention of teaching case-based sustainability and promoting the University of Michigan as a leader in sustainability focused education.
