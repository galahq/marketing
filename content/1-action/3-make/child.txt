So you want to build a case? That’s great! 

Please keep in mind that MSCs are created through teamwork, comprised of a mix of students, faculty and practitioners. Each case requires a dynamic, narrative body of main text, multi-media Edgenotes, a podcast, learning exercises, and teaching guide. 

Most of all, each case requires an important sustainability challenge. Inspiration for existing cases have come from local news, research articles and first-hand experiences. We look forward to turning your idea into an MSC.
