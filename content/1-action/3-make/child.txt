Text: 

MSCs are created through teamwork, comprised of a mix of students, faculty and practitioners. Each case requires a dynamic, narrative body of main text, multi-media Edgenotes, a podcast, learning exercises, and teaching guide. 

This process is student-drive, on the one hand allowing students to design for students, on the other hand, enabling students to partner with professors, practitioners, and media design specialists to hone their analytical, professional networking, and communication skills. 

> I honed my writing and content development skills during the case creation process. I further gained my presentational and facilitation skills in implementing the case for an undergraduate class in winter 2016. – <span>Arman Golrokhian, author for the Ethiopia National Adaptation case</span>
