##Review Dropbox
Each case team will receive access to a folder named Review Dropbox in the M Box system. This is your space to use for storing case-related materials, and it also serves as a means for sharing files with the MSC team. Within the Review Dropbox, each case team will also have an Audio folder assigned to them, where working audio files for Edgenotes and supplementary media may be uploaded.
