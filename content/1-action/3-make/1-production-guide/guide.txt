Intro: 
Inspiration for a case may come from a current or past event or a published work. Each case is presented with the following components: main text, teaching guide, multi-media Edgenotes, podcast, and learning exercises.

# Case narrative
Typically, a case presents the following components:
1. a problem, 
2. a central decision maker, 
3. the actors, stakeholders and interest groups who influence the decision making process,
3. options for possible solutions,
4. competing objectives and tradeoffs, 
5. implementation challenges, and
6.  recommendations.
The suggested length for an MSC is between 3,000 - 5,000 words. 
# Teaching guide
The teaching guide should explicitly lay out recommendations for how to use case materials, including:
1. a brief case overview explaining the issue and components, 
2. teaching objectives of concepts, qualitative and quantitative skills,
3. how to incorporate Edgenotes and podcast,
4. recommended questions for further discussion, and
5. learning exercises and how to implement them in the classroom.
# Curating Edgenotes
Edgenotes can be drawn from a variety multimedia sources:
1. video or audio clips
2. essays, columns and blogs
3. infographics, charts and graphs
4. tweets from the ground
5. technical reports
# Podcasts
The ideal MSC podcast features:
1. interviews with the case decision maker(s) and/or relevant experts
2. discussion and dialogue untangling case narratives and assumptions
# Interactive Learning Exercises
Interactive learning exercises should be 2-3 different skill based activities that require the students to work either qualitatively or quantitatively with the case materials.
1. at least one exercise for teams of two or more students
2. at least one exercise for individual student work
# Team Composition
Teams are made up of professors, practitioners, and students who work collaboratively to write and produce a case.
1. the professor’s role is to provide expertise and advise on the case
2. the practitioner’s role is give perspective from the industry or professional reality
3. the student’s role is to write the case, curate the Edgenotes, coordinate the podcast production and learn in the process
# Publishing your case
Each MSC is published.
1. the case are published on the MSC website; this includes the case narrative, teaching guide, Edgenotes, podcast, and interactive learning exercises
2. if the student authors and faculty are interested in an academic publication of the case, there is a strong possibility of it being accepted to World Development Perspectives
