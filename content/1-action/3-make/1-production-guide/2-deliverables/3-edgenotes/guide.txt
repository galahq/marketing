Title: Edgenotes

----

Text: 

Edgenotes are complementary multimedia features that provide a jumping-off point for deeper exploration within a case. These   materials aim to enhance the learning experience by curating the most relevant content available. (link: http://www.lib.umich.edu/askwith-media-library text:Askwith Media Library) has partnered with MSC to help case makers find authoritative, captivating material for Edgenotes.

Edgenotes should meet the following criteria:
- Be from a reliable source. A librarian or the faculty advisor can help student authors determine the reliability of a source.
- Be current and up-to-date, unless an Edgenote is exploring some historical aspect.
- Link to a stable URL if possible.
- Be thoughtfully placed in the narrative. Ask yourself, 'What value does an Edgenote add here?'
- Vary in type. In other words, it's best to have a mix of different types of Edgenotes.
- Be generally interesting. If you, as the author, think it's a boring Edgenote, it probably is!

For each Edgenote, we need several pieces of information, which differ based on the Edgenote type: image/graphic, video, audio, and external links.
