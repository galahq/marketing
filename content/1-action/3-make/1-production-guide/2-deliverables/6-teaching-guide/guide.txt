Title: Teaching Guide

----

Text: 

The teaching guide outlines best practices for use of the case, details the opportunities available to adapt the case for different audiences, and provides the tools needed by instructors to evaluate their students. Any instructor who picks it up should be able to teach the case without involving the case authors. It is only visible to instructors (e.g. professors).

##Requirements
*Please note: Once you are ready to submit your work, use this (file: msc_teachingguide_template.docx text: teaching guide template) to input your content.*

1. ###Case overview
A short summary of the case.
2. ###Learning objectives
Describe the knowledge, skills, and attitudes students should acquire through studying the case. Learning objectives should be explicit and specific, and use action verbs to define the desired student competency. This (link:http://tll.mit.edu/help/teaching-materials-0 text:short guide to writing learning objectives) may be helpful.
3. ###Suggested audience
Describe who the case was written for (e.g. undergraduate or graduate students, NGO, etc.) and why. Also detail what other courses or learning environments this case might be useful for.
4. ###Previous knowledge
List what students should know before studying the case.
5. ###Teaching plan
Provide guidance and suggestions to other instructors for how the case may be incorporated into the classroom, including use of time. Discussion or assignment questions and answers may be included (optional). Additionally, explain how the podcast relates to the case narrative—does it further unpack the issue, critique a dominant narrative, add further information or theory, or something else?
6. ###Directions for Engaged Learning Exercise
Provide directions for using the engaged learning exercise. These instructions should be comprehensible to anyone wishing to use the case and give sufficient information such that the case authors need not be contacted. Some case teams prefer to provide several different activities for an instructor to choose from. In this situation, provide instructions for each exercise and when an instructor might want to choose each option. 
7. ###Assessment
Provide suggestions for assessing student learning with the case using direct and/or indirect measures. Direct measures include papers, projects, tests and quizzes, etc. Indirect measures include surveys, focus groups, etc. Assessment should be directly linked to the learning objectives listed above.
