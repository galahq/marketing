Title: Case Promotion

----

Text: 

We promote cases both locally and globally. 

Local promotion happens through our podcases broadcast on (link: http://www.hotinhere.us/ text:local radio), where we air the podcast as well as welcome case authors in studio, then open phone lines for community feedback and questions. 

Broader promotion happens through conferences hosted by some of our partner organizations, where we are able to showcase existing cases, workshop emerging cases, and solicit case suggestions for future production or for our competition. The first such showcase happened in Baltimore in October 2016 at the American Association for Sustainability in Higher Education or AASHE meetings. A second happened in Ann Arbor in May 2017 at the Association for Law, Property and Society or ALPS meetings, and a third in June 2017 at the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors or AEESP meeting.
