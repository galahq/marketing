    MSCs are digital. This allows students
    from all over the world to easily access
    them. The platform is responsive to
    different screen sizes, so students can
    engage via a computer, tablet or
    smartphone. And offer students the
    opportunity to listen and learn on the
    go.

But, the wide array of Edgenotes and interactive learning exercises can be catered to specific academic fields.   The modularity of MSCs can suit a variety of classrooms. The cases can fit into any teaching schedule. Use one case for a few class hours or configure “stacks” of cases to form cohesive curricula. '
