MSCs provide an immersive and exploratory educational approach to acquire practical skills in environmental sustainability. Each MSC tells a story: First, a real-world based problem with a challenging decision. Then, perspectives from key decision maker and main stakeholders, accompanied by audiovisual resources providing diverse and in-depth insights. Lastly, interactive learning exercises for students to analyze priorities and tradeoffs.

The multifarious challenges of ‘wicked’ problems like climate changes and energy security bring to light the complex reality of sustainability in our world. In response, we are building critical interdisciplinary skills that will last beyond the classroom. Real problems are narrated through the eyes of real decision makers and stakeholders that present students with different aspects of solving complex problems in the real world.

- Start by seeing problems through the eyes of decision–makers.  
- “Meet" different stakeholders and hear their perspectives via audiovisual Edgenotes. 
- Dig deeper into facts through graphics and technical reports. 
- Work with others in exercises designed to build practical skills, from quantitative analysis to stronger collaboration.

### Real 
Some MSCs come from right on our doorstep; others come from the other side of the world. All are grounded in actual sustainability crises. For instance: 
(imgix: learnwitharticle.jpg class: image-float-right)
- In May 2016, Michigan local media MLive published an article titled *Should cleaning up the Gelman dioxane plume be a national priority?*, MSC author Anna Prushinskaya has been following up with the issue and producing a case on how city, county, and federal actors confer about whether or not Ann Arbor should be a super fund site when limited remediation where cleanup is too costly. 
- Since 2014, major medias like the BBC news has talked about the E-waste problem in Ghana. Tapping into an existing University of Michigan project, student authors Anne Canavati and Jayson Toweh traveled along with their faculty advisor Adam Simon to the site and interview local people and companies about this issue.
- In 2014, Fair Trade USA on fair trade coffee in Peru and that it is the perfect merge of quality and sustainability. After looking more into the issue, student author Carissa de Young and faculty advisor Joe Arvai realized that certification is a complex process and consumers increasingly have alternatives. They are now working on an MSC that looks into whether or not direct trade supply chains better for Peruvian coffee producers.
- ...Our case authors find inspiration in recent and ongoing research, activism, journalism and much more.
