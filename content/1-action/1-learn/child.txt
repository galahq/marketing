MSCs provide an immersive and exploratory educational approach to acquire practical skills in environmental sustainability. Each MSC tells a story. First, a real-world based problem with a challenging decision. Then, perspectives from key decision maker and main stakeholders, accompanied by audiovisual resources providing diverse and in-depth insights. Finally, interactive learning exercises for students to analyze priorities and tradeoffs.

The multifarious challenges of ‘wicked’ problems like climate changes and energy security bring to light the complex reality of sustainability in our world. In response, we are building critical interdisciplinary skills that will last beyond the classroom. Real problems are narrated through the eyes of real decision makers and stakeholders that present students with different aspects of solving complex problems in the real world.

- Start by seeing problems through the eyes of decision–makers. Our (link:element/narrative text:narrative) style leads to inductive learning.
- “Meet" different stakeholders and experts and dig deeper into facts via (link:element/edgenote text:multimedia Edgenotes) and the (link:element/podcast text:podcast). These elements expand the spectrum of perspectives.
- Finally, it’s time to react. (link:element/exercise text:Engaged learning exercises)  allow you to build skills while putting them into practice. Apply your knowledge and come to real-life decisions. 

### Inspiration from the world around us
Some MSCs come from right on our doorstep; others come from the other side of the world. Our case authors find inspiration in recent and ongoing research, activism and journalism. All are grounded in actual sustainability crises. Here are just a few examples: 
(imgix: learnwitharticle2.jpg class: image-float-right)
- A May 2016 article by Michigan local media MLive, *Should cleaning up the Gelman dioxane plume be a national priority?*, addresses an issue of great interest to UM student Anna Prushinskaya. Anna has been producing an MSC on how city, county, and federal actors come to a decision on whether a full scale clean-up of this environmental disaster, or just a 'mitigation' of the risks, is most appropriate.
- Since 2014, e-waste in Ghana has attracted enormous international media attention. Joining forces with an ongoing University of Michigan project, students Anne Canavati and Jayson Toweh traveled in mid 2016, along with faculty advisor Adam Simon, around Ghana. Their mission: to bring the voices of residents and companies on the risks and potentials of e-waste into their own MSC.
- In 2014, an article by Fair Trade USA described fair trade coffee in Peru as "the perfect merge of quality and sustainability". Inspired to dig deeper, student Carissa de Young and faculty advisor Joe Arvai quickly realized that certification in Peru is more complicated than the "perfect" picture presented in the article. They are now writing an MSC that examines the effects of direct trade supply chains for Peruvian coffee producers.
