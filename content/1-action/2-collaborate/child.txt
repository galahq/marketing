Collaboration is critical to MSC, from case inception to (link:../element/exercise text:in-class interactive exercises) and all the way to final decision making. Yet, MSC also wants to facilitate collaboration at *different scales*. So, we are develping an additional function: *online groups*, formed by interest, discipline, location, classrooms, or study groups. These groups will provide *unique lenses* for students and others to shift amongst perspectives on any given case.

As you explore a case, turn comments off and read it through your own eyes. Then, make comments visible by groups that interest you, such as your peers, engineers, policymakers, or planners. Comments are found right on the page where inspiration strikes. Draw from the insights of others to help solve the sustainability dilemma. 

*Comment streams* highlight particular themes or interests and facilitate greater interdisciplinary learning.

##Expand your learning with communities of practice

<div class="icon-h3"><h3>Private Groups</h3></div>
For quick access to insights from your peers, establish groups by:
- Campus 
- Classroom
- Individual study group

Not restricted to formal educational institutions, private groups can also be established in organizations like NGOs or companies. Certain private comment streams can (with permission) be lifted into other private as well as public groups. In this way, discussions are preserved and passed on to new learners, making the cases living entities that are constantly evolving.

<div class="icon-h3"><h3>Public Groups</h3></div>
Public groups are open access, for broader participation of those who have first-hand knowledge of or a stake in the cases. These groups are established by:
- Interest — such as on policy standpoints, activism, urban gardening, beekeeping, …
- Identity — such as indigenous, feminist, capitalist, neo-Marxist, …
- Discipline — such as engineering, anthropology, planning, public health, design, …
- Place — such as by country, region, town, village, …
- and anything else that develops organically through user involvement.

Motivated by urgent sustainability challenges, the informal learning produced by these groups transcends geographical, cultural, and generational distances.
