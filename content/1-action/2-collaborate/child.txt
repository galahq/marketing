Collaboration is critical to MSC, from case inception all the way to final decision making. Yet, MSC also wants to promote collaboration at different scales. So, an additional function is currently under development: **online groups**, formed by interest, discipline, location, classrooms or study groups. These groups will provide unique lenses for students and others to shift amongst perspectives on any given case.

As you explore a case, you can turn comments off and read it with your own eyes. Then, make visible the comments by groups that interest you, such as your peers, engineers, policymakers, or planners. Comments are found right on the page where inspiration strikes (rather than in a list at the bottom of the page). Draw from the insights of others to help solve the sustainability dilemma. 

Discussion streams thus highlight particular themes or interests and facilitate greater interdisciplinary learning.

##Using the Groups function to expand your learning
###Private Groups
For quick access to insights from your peers, establish groups by:
- Campus 
- Classroom
- Individual study group

Not restricted to formal education institutions, private groups can also be established in organizations like NGOs or companies. Certain private comment streams can (with permission) be lifted into other private as well as public groups. In this way, discussions are preserved and passed on to new learners, making the cases living entities that are constantly evolving. 

###Public Groups
Public groups are open access, for broader participation of those who have first-hand knowledge of or a stake in the cases. These groups are established by:
- Interest, such as with regard to specific policy or advocacy standpoints, farmers, unions, …
- Identity, such as indigenous, women, feminists, capitalists, neo-Marxists, …
- Discipline, such as engineering, anthropology, planning or design, …
- Place, such as by country (e.g. China, Bolivia) or region (e.g. west Africa, northeast USA), …
- and whatever else develops organically through user involvement, …

Motivated by urgent sustainability challenges, the informal learning produced by these groups transcends geographical, cultural, and generational distances.
