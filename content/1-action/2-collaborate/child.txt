Collaboration features at many points in MSC, from case inception to final decision-making. Right now, we are developing an additional function to further promote collaboration at different scales. Online groups formed by interest, discipline, location, classrooms or study group, will provide unique lenses to shift amongst perspectives on any given case.

As you explore a case, you can turn comments off and read it with your own eyes. Then, make visible the comments by groups that interest you, such as your peers, engineers, policymakers, or planners. Comments go right on the page where inspiration strikes (rather than in a list at the bottom of the page). Draw from the insights of others to help solve the sustainability dilemma. 

Discussion streams thus highlight particular themes or interests and facilitate greater interdisciplinary learning.

##How the Groups Work?
###Private groups
For quick access to the thoughts of your peers, these groups can be established by:
- Campus 
- Classroom
- Individual study group
Not restricted to formal education institutions, ‘classrooms’ can also be established in private organizations like NGOs or companies. 

Certain private comment streams can (with permission) be lifted into other private as well as public groups. In this way, discussions are preserved and passed on to new learners, making the cases living entities that are constantly evolving. 

###Public Groups
Public groups are open access, for broader participation of those who have first-hand knowledge of or a stake in the cases. These groups are established by:
- Interest, such as with regard to specific policy or advocacy standpoints, farmers, unions…
- Identity, such as indigenous, women, feminists, capitalists, neo-Marxists…
- Discipline, such as engineering, anthropology, planning or design…
- Place, such as by country (e.g. China, Bolivia) or region (e.g. west Africa, northeast USA)…
- and whatever else develops organically through user involvement…
Motivated by urgent sustainability challenges, the informal learning produced by these groups transcends geographical, cultural, and generational distances.
