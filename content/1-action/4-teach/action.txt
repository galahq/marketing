Description: The modularity of MSCs can suit a variety of classrooms. The cases can fit into any teaching schedule. Use one case for a few class hours or configure “stacks” of cases to form cohesive curricula. Our cases are produced by teams of students and faculty with outside practitioners to leverage hands-on knowledge in relation to theory, and showcase local and global collaborative efforts. You can access MSC from different devices all over the world.
