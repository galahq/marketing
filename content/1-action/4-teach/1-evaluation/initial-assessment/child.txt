Dr. Rebecca Hardin piloted the (link: http://www.learnmsc.org/cases/mi-wolves#/ text:Wolf case) and the (link: http://www.learnmsc.org/cases/ethiopia-napa#/ text: Ethiopia case) in her class during winter term of 2016. 

Formative assessment of the cases were drawn from focus groups and a qualitative survey instrument (with a response rate of approximately 82%, or 33 out of 40 students).

The results provide initial positive evidence in favor of the active learning, problem solving curricular materials embodied in the MSC, particularly for audiences of non-traditional students. One such student, from a farming family in northern Michigan, commented, ‘‘To be honest, this case is the first assigned reading I have actually completed all the reading for this term. It was more contained, easier to focus on, more fun to read because of the videos and the visual aids.”

Our exam graders checked essay questions against student profiles used to verify our randomized sample groups, and found that minority and non-traditional students made more detailed use of Kidane and his story in their essays than did students with more conventional backgrounds and family histories of strong higher education access. The latter were more likely to explain abstract concepts from scholarly articles and apply them to ethnographic texts or journalistic examples, while the former were more likely to illustrate those concepts with reference to the decision maker and the case context. Further, first generation student survey responses indicated that they gained more depth and breadth of knowledge from using the cases than did other students (see Fig. 1). 

First generation students also felt more in control of the pace of learning in the student group that used the case approach (see Fig. 2).

Equally interesting information comes from a comparison of the learning outcomes for the larger undergraduate class in which the Ethiopia adaptation case was used in 2016 compared to the same class in 2015 when no case method was used. Assuming comparability between the 2015 and 2016 classes on several dimensions, we find that case-based learning leads to a mean improvement in test scores of approximately 5% compared to the student cohort that did not use the case method (a mean increase of 1.12 points out of total available 20 points for the midterm examination in 2016 compared to 2015—see Fig. 3 below for a distribution of the scores for the class). The difference between student midterm scores in 2015 versus 2016 is 7.5%, statistically significant at the 95 percent confidence level. Student testing controlled for several potential additional sources of variability that may affect the course grades by using the same questions in the same order for the test, employing the same rubric for grading, and using the same graders for the examination in both years.

Finally, the Master’s level students who created the Ethiopia case expressed in interviews that they honed writing, analytical, content, communication, and professional networking skills through their work on the case in 2014–2015, and further gained presentational and facilitation skills in implementing the case for undergraduates in 2015–2016. This is proof of concept that our notion of ‘‘flipping the curriculum” is value added in education or professional training, enabling today’s students to partner with professors, practitioners, and media design specialists to create not mere final projects but actual learning materials for future students and professionals. MSC materials can be effectively created and then adopted, adapted or updated across the sometimes sterile separate categories of ‘‘applied” and ‘‘basic” science, or communities of undergraduate, professional, and graduate students or even students and alumni from a given program or campus. Such interconnections bear the most promising possibilities for revolutionizing education at a pace that is commensurate with the severity and spread of sustainability challenges.
