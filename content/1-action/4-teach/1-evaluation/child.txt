Title: Evaluation

----

Text: 

Problem-based and case-based learning have long and successful track records in education. MSC takes these methods further, by *harnessing new technologies to both activate students* throughout the learning process and expose them to the increasingly complex reality of today’s world. 

MSC is being critically assessed by in-house scholars.  For instance, a study of the first stages of MSC implementation in two classrooms produced positive results (Hardin et al. 2016), INSERT 1-2 Graphs from that paper, plus very brief explanations...

*"To be honest, this case is the first assigned reading I have actually completed all the reading for this term. It was more contained, easier to focus on, more fun to read because of the videos and the visual aids."*  -Student from MSC pilot course, Winter 2016

Another study of an MSC development process demonstrated MSC’s pedagogical commitment to making clear to students the challenges of decision-making with imperfect information (Golrokhian et al. 2016). 

MSC is committed to *continuous evaluation*. We actively seek user feedback and stay abreast of cutting edge pedagogical debates. These efforts will inform udates to current cases and future case production.

**Keep an eye on this page as our project and case assessments progress.**
