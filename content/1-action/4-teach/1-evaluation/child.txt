Title: Evaluation

----

Text: 

Problem-based and case-based learning have long and successful track records in education. MSC takes these methods further, by *harnessing new technologies* to both *activate students* throughout the learning process and *expose them* to the increasingly *complex reality* of today’s world.

MSC is being critically assessed by in-house scholars in partnership with the Center for Research on Learning and Teaching (CRLT).  For instance, a pilot study of MSC in two classrooms showed positive results (Hardin et al. 2016). Students largely preferred MSC’s multimedia-enhanced materials (as compared to plain text/ printed materials) (Chart 1), and indicated higher levels of engagement in the course (as compared to classes with primarily lecture-based teaching) (Chart 2). 

*"To be honest, this case is the first assigned reading I have actually completed all the reading for this term. It was more contained, easier to focus on, more fun to read because of the videos and the visual aids."*  -Student from MSC pilot course, Winter 2016.

Another study of an MSC development process demonstrated MSC’s pedagogical commitment to making clear to students the challenges of decision-making with imperfect information (Golrokhian et al. 2016). 

MSC is committed to *continuous evaluation*. We actively seek user feedback and stay abreast of cutting-edge pedagogical debates. These efforts will inform updates to current cases and future case production.

*Keep an eye on this page as our project and case assessments progress.*
