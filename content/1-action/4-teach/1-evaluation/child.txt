Benefits of our approach also include the ways our process, regardless of data and outcomes, will address two fundamental priorities in current STEM formal and informal education models. First, that too little educational innovation is occurring to link the widening experiential base of sustainability challenges to better uptake of basic scientific and technical concepts relevant to local and more global food, water,
and energy needs. Second, too few students from first generation or non traditional learning backgrounds are given access to international engagement and professional interaction in their early training, enabling them to assimilate to shifting professional cultures on sustainability challenges, and to learn by doing in ways that enable paths into (and back out of!) formal education, attaining confidence (Harvin 2015;
Magolda 2008).
