Title: Evaluation

----

Text: 

Problem-based and case-based learning have long and successful track records in education. MSC takes these methods further, by *harnessing new technologies* to both *activate students* throughout the learning process and *expose them* to the increasingly *complex reality* of today’s world.

MSC is being critically assessed by in-house scholars in partnership with the Center for Research on Learning and Teaching (CRLT).  For instance, a pilot study of MSC in two classrooms showed positive results (<a href="http://ac.els-cdn.com/S2452292916300820/1-s2.0-S2452292916300820-main.pdf?_tid=d299d666-8a39-11e6-9663-00000aab0f01&acdnat=1475589343_446ab927a93a79d52d423ccb4587d97a">Hardin et al. 2016</a>). Students largely preferred MSC’s multimedia-enhanced materials (as compared to plain text/ printed materials) (Chart 1), and indicated higher levels of engagement in the course (as compared to classes with primarily lecture-based teaching) (Chart 2). 

*"To be honest, this case is the first assigned reading I have actually completed all the reading for this term. It was more contained, easier to focus on, more fun to read because of the videos and the visual aids."*  -Student from MSC pilot course, Winter 2016.

Another study of an MSC development process demonstrated MSC’s pedagogical commitment to making clear to students the challenges of decision-making with imperfect information (<a href="http://ac.els-cdn.com/S2452292916300856/1-s2.0-S2452292916300856-main.pdf?_tid=1cf3eb02-8a3a-11e6-8330-00000aab0f6b&acdnat=1475589468_a27eb423c9cdc5c28b4a0981b8c4254b">Golrokhian et al. 2016</a>). 

MSC is committed to *continuous evaluation*. We actively seek user feedback and stay abreast of cutting-edge pedagogical debates. These efforts will inform updates to current cases and future case production.

*Keep an eye on this page as our project and case assessments progress.*
