Teaching the next generation of sustainability leaders?

The next generation of scientists, policy makers, entrepreneurs and engineers need innovative approaches and thoughtful guidance to be ready to respond to increasingly wicked sustainability dilemmas. To equip students to navigate information deficits, uncertainties and social asymmetries, pedagogical methods must enable thinking that is systematic, creative, socially just and inter-culturally intelligent. 

Current modes of sustainability education typically rely on the outdated pedagogy of traditional lectures, which suppress student interest. The Michigan Sustainability Cases (MSC) initiative is expanding upon the best of case-based learning, building problem-driven, solution-focused approaches emphasizing student-driven experiential learning.  Learn more about how MSC envisions sustainability education of the future, here.

## Some Heading
###‘Blended’ learning
MSCs were conceptualized to support blended learning approaches, harnessing the best of online and face to face learning. MSCs ‘flip’ classrooms, equipping students before they get to class, for face to face engagement. This minimizes the need for traditional top down lectures that restrict active participation. 

Instructors can also choose to go fully online for distance learning. 

###Modular
Because MSCs are both interdisciplinary and modular, they are useful to many types of classrooms and teaching schedules. Bring in a single case or configure “stacks” of cases to form a cohesive curriculum. Each case leverages hands-on knowledge in relation to theory and emphasizes practical skill development.

###Accessible 
MSCs are digitally enhanced to allow easy access from different devices around the world. The platform is responsive to different screen sizes, so students can engage via a computer, tablet or smartphone. It offers students the opportunity to listen and learn on the go.

###Effective
MSC is much more effective in equipping students with the competencies to solve complex problems.
