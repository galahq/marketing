Teaching the next generation of sustainability leaders? Budding scientists, policy makers, entrepreneurs, and engineers need *innovative approaches* and *thoughtful guidance* to be ready to respond to increasingly wicked sustainability dilemmas over the course of their careers. To equip students to navigate information deficits, uncertainties, and social asymmetries, pedagogical methods must enable thinking that is *systematic, creative, socially just*, and *interculturally intelligent*. We think it should also be free, easy to adapt to your current teaching practices, yet transformative of your relationship with students, and their relationships to wider worlds.

Current modes of sustainability education rely on traditional lectures, which have been clearly shown to suppress student creativity and engagement, and to favor some types of learners over others. MSC is expanding upon the best of case-based learning, building problem-driven, solution-focused, multi-modal approaches emphasizing experiential learning. Learn more about how MSC envisions sustainability education of the future below. That future builds on long experience; Professor Steve Yaffee, author of our Wolf Wars case, speaks from over 30 years of work writing and teaching cases.

##How can MSCs serve you?##
MSCs impart enormous benefits for instructors.

1. ###‘Blended’ Learning
MSCs are not online learning. Rather, they harness the best of online and face to face learning. MSCs ‘flip’ classrooms, equipping students before they get to class, for meaningful discussions. This minimizes the need for traditional top-down lectures that restrict active participation. Instructors can also choose to go fully online for distance learning.

2. ###Modular
You can use our cases *à la carte* or as a full menu. Because MSCs are both interdisciplinary and international in scope, they can be combined in a wide range of ways for many types of classrooms and teaching schedules. Bring in a single case or configure stacks of cases to form a cohesive curriculum. Each case leverages hands-on knowledge in relation to theory and emphasizes practical skill development.

3. ###Open Access
MSCs are free to educators, partner practitioners, and students. Further, they are digitally enhanced to allow easy access from different devices around the world. The platform is responsive to different screen sizes, so students can take part via computer, tablet, or smartphone. It offers students the opportunity to listen and learn on the go.

4. ###Evidence Based
How do we know MSC is so effective in equipping students with the competencies needed to solve complex problems? Because we build assessment tools into every case we produce, and we analyze case use in classrooms and beyond. We help you develop learning objectives, then use qualitative focus groups for formative evaluation, as well as offering more quantitative methods. <br>(link:action/teach/evaluation text: Read more ›)
