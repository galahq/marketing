Indeed, the complexity and connectedness of human-environmental interactions demands that
educational institutions, nonprofits, corporations, and government agencies implement strategies that help
the next generation of scientists, policy makers, entrepreneurs and engineers learn to acknowledge the
difficulties in solving sustainability dilemmas, but also become accustomed to thinking through these
difficulties. Operating effectively in a context of information deficits, uncertainties, and social asymmetries
of wicked sustainability dilemmas requires a greater focus on decision making in these contexts, from the
very beginning when decision makers arrive in classrooms (Skerlos, 2015). Innovative pedagogical
methods must focus on enabling decision makers to think systematically, collaboratively, creatively, and
with intercultural intelligence. They must learn to work together to craft solutions drawing upon insights
from multiple relevant disciplines and fields of knowledge.

Urgent calls for innovative sustainability pedagogies (Segalas et al (2010), Cotton and Winter (2010),
Wiek et al (2011)) have accompanied emerging key competencies expected from professionals in the
sustainability field. They conclude that future sustainability professionals are expected to craft
cost-effective solutions, design and implement strategic interventions, communicate effectively, and work
collaboratively to solve problems. One might add that many of the problems they confront are likely to
occur in environments with low information, high uncertainty, and multiple competing interests.
Conventional pedagogical methods, in formal settings focused often on information delivery and
communication of factual knowledge through lectures and problem sets, are ill-equipped to support the
development of these core-competencies.


This combination of sites
and networks of stakeholders can give rise to curricular tools that would have global impact, rooted in
specific tethering of face to face collaborations to build and make sustainable technologies, with cases
that offer insights into the social contexts and scientific concepts that surround, enable, and suffuse those technologies

#####Modularity

##For different timelines and classrooms.

The modularity of MSCs can suit a variety of classrooms. The cases can fit into any teaching schedule. Use one case for a few class hours or configure “stacks” of cases to form cohesive curricula. Our cases are produced by teams of students and faculty with outside practitioners to leverage hands-on knowledge in relation to theory, and showcase local and global collaborative efforts.
