MSCâ€™s innovative approach strives to make sustainability teaching and learning more case-based, dynamic, and engaging. Through our platform, students, instructors, and practitioners are encouraged to participate in case creating, learning, teaching, and sharing processes.

The increasing challenges of wicked problems like climate changes and energy descent pose across disciplines is something that should be included in core curriculums. We are making it more approachable and more engaging while building critical skills beyond the classroom. 

You mention the hands-on, practical approach, and the involvement of non-academic 'outside-practitioners'. 

where you depart: from often still solely text-based, sender (teacher) - receiver (student), or input (lecture) - output (test) models. Maybe you could add that excursions and summer travel programs abroad are also potential ways of an interactive learning experience.
