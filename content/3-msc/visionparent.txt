Description: 

- Number 1 platform for sustainability oriented teaching cases.
For decades, professors have been successfully teaching with cases. MSC is reimagining this technique by building a web-based learning platform that embraces the new mode of media consumption, popularized by aggregators like Facebook or Flipboard.

- - 100+ current case producers
Every MSC is produced by a team of students, faculty, and practitioners. $2 Million initial funding from Transforming Learning in the Third Century is being spent to support the development of cases. Currently, MSC is supporting the development of over 30 cases, which involve over 100 individuals.

- 15 + on campus partners
MSC is currently writing and piloting initial cases in a variety of professional schools, ranging from its current home in the School of Natural Resources to Engineering, Social Work, and beyond. MSC has also build partners to help make MSC more digitally savvy and inclusive of different backgrounds. On top of this, MSC is extending its reach by building partners beyond campus and globally. transforming sustainability learning at home on the University of Michigan campus and bringing cases to classrooms around the world.

- 95% satisfaction rate in piloting cases
Two MSCs were piloted in the classroom of winter semester 2016. Positive feedbacks are received. Among which, the overall satisfaction rate is 95%.

- 200 cases in the course of four years
One barrier of adopting new pedagogy is the cost of making such change. Cases are expensive to produce. MSC is aiming to support 125 to 200 cases production in the next four years, all of which are open access. Allowing wider adoption of this approach.

- 30+ years of case based teaching
For decades, School of Natural Resources and Environment (SNRE) professors have been successfully teaching with cases in their classrooms, which have proved more effective than lectures. Case approach has also been adopted for the SNRE orientation to give students the feeling of the complexity of environmental issues. The experience will help MSC to build cases well...

Our goal is to transform sustainability learning by transforming teaching methods in all academic fields. Case-based curricular innovation will lead to a more engaged, participatory learning. It will also enable students to achieve sustainability competencies, including systems-thinking: anticipatory, normative, strategic, and interpersonal. These are skills that will help develop students towards their full potential—becoming future sustainability leaders.

Michigan Sustainability Cases Initiative (MSC) was initially funded with a  $2 million grant from the Transforming Learning in the Third Century initiative, to build a case-based curriculum for sustainability education in a variety of professional schools. MSC is writing and piloting initial cases throughout the U-M campus from its current home in the School of Natural Resources & Environment (SNRE). For over 30 years, SNRE professors have successfully taught with case-based learning in their classrooms. This have proved more effective than lectures. MSC is reimagining this technique, while drawing from decades of in-house experience.

‘MSC’ also refers to the individual case products by the Initiative. MSCs are modular multimedia sustainability cases developed through partnerships with practitioners, teachers and students. Our series of cases are presented via the MSC online platform. Like the traditional case method, MSCs present students with a case, a decision maker, and various stakeholders, allowing the student to analyze priorities and tradeoffs in reaching a recommendation. Unlike the traditional case method, each MSC is accompanied by two “tentpole” components (multimedia “Edgenotes” and an hour-long podcast). Together, these bring greater depth to the case, producing a more engaged, participatory learning. It will also enable students to achieve sustainability competencies, which will help develop students towards their full potential—becoming future sustainability leaders.

The creation of a sustainability-focused case library will be both time and resource intensive. MSC employs student authors who write the cases, curate the Edgenotes, and produce the podcasts themselves, in consultation with faculty, practitioners, and MSC staff. This allows for a secondary learning objective for student MSC makers, to develop skills in critical thought, time management, teaching and teamwork.

This initiative will widely encourage case-based teaching and learning methods across the University of Michigan campus, the U.S., and eventually (fingers crossed) the world.
