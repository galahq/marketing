Description: 

Michigan Sustainability Cases (MSC), funded by a Transforming Learning in the Third Century initiative, is building a case-based curriculum for sustainability education in a variety of professional schools. MSC is writing and piloting initial cases throughout the U-M campus ranging from its current home in the SNRE  to Engineering, Social Work, and beyond.
The MSC initiative is focused on developing a series of cases that will be presented via the MSC online platform, which encourages student interaction with the case material. As with the traditional case method, MSCs present the student with the case, the decision maker, and various stakeholders, allowing the student to analyze priorities and tradeoffs in reaching a recommendation. Unlike the traditional case method, each MSC is accompanied by two additional “tentpole” components (multimedia “Edgenotes” and an hour-long podcast),  which together serve to bring greater depth to the case content.  Through the seamless incorporation of diverse  audiovisual sources and in-depth interviews with real world decision makers, MSCs provide a more immersive and nuanced educational approach to sustainability and environmental decision making.
Besides MSCs campus-wide influence, we expect to have a worldwide impact by building global partners and hosting the global case competition.

###The MSC Approach
*Stories that revolve around critical issues and key players.*
Like traditional case studies, a standard MSC is composed of a clear narrative with a decision problem, one or more decision points, and several available solutions. With a seamless incorporation of diverse audiovisual sources and in-depth interviews with real-world decision makers, MSCs revolutionize traditional case-based learning, providing a more immersive and nuanced educational experience in sustainability and environmental decision making.

*Cases lead students through complex issues and help knowledge to ‘stick’. *
Emerging ‘wicked’ sustainability problems produced by for instance climate change are no longer limited to traditional environmental fields. They are complicated, posing challenges and requiring knowledge across disciplines- yet they deserve attention even in core curriculums. Case-based learning creates space for such complexity, conveying a bigger picture even when addressing site-specific sustainability challenges.  

*Designed by students, for students.*
MSC employs student authors who write the cases, curate the Edgenotes, and produce the podcasts themselves, in consultation with faculty, practitioners, and MSC staff. This allows for a secondary learning objective for student MSC makers, to develop skills in critical thought, time management, teaching and teamwork.

*Open Access Library, for stories that evolve.*
MSC provides a library of cases that are modular to fit into a variety of classrooms, or configured in “stacks” which form cohesive curricula. This library is open access for ongoing collaboration and development. In other words, life goes on, and so do our cases.

###MSC Aspirations 

Our overarching didactical ambition is to help students achieve sustainability competencies including: systems-thinking, anticipatory, normative, strategic, and interpersonal.* These skills will help develop critical, reflective and thoughtful future sustainability leaders.

With thoughtful pedagogy guiding the use of innovative e-tools and an engaging narrative style, MSC will transform sustainability learning on UM campuses as well as serving as a model for sustainability education globally. MSC will also facilitate a global sustainability learning community by building global partnerships, with resources and support for students who are interested in this ever-growing field to participate. 

With 200 cases by 2020 and some 150-200 individual case studies made publicly accessible, MSC hopes to capture the attention of pre-college and current students around the world and promote the University of Michigan as a leader in sustainability education.
