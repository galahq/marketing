Title: 2017 MSC-Gala Strategic Advisors Meeting

----

Text:

Case studies have emerged as a globally relevant pedagogical tool across multiple fields, spanning the breadth of environment and sustainability issues. The value of case studies is not limited to classrooms, however, and the opportunity to use them for broader social, economic, and environmental impacts is becoming increasingly clear. Recognizing a critical need for knowledge exchange in this area, Michigan Sustainability Cases (MSC) convened a group of colleagues from initiatives that have pioneered the use of case-based learning and innovative digital tools for environment and sustainability education.

This gathering (Oct 13-15) brought together a group of local, national, and international partners to exchange insights about the future of case-based learning and explore areas for collaboration. Attendees included participants from Harvard University, the Indian School of Business, the National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC), Tsinghua University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Yale University, along with Academic Innovation (University of Michigan) and the City of Ann Arbor.

The meeting opened on Friday evening by framing the mission of all present: to bring the full potential of case-based learning to bear on broader educational, social, and environmental impacts. At a brainstorming session the following day, participants honed in on the unique challenges of environment and sustainability education, and what case studies can offer. Participants noted that these issues tend to be more complex, place more emphasis on human aspects, and typically describe problems for which there is great uncertainty and no one right answer.

The MSC team then highlighted a new space for collaboration: the open-access Gala platform.

Though it currently hosts content produced through the MSC initiative, the platform offers multimedia integration, analytics tools, and other features that may benefit all case study producers. Participants noted several exciting things these features can do, including facilitating more active stakeholder engagement, providing different angles and spatial perspectives, and allowing users to visually anticipate future scenarios. Overall, the group expressed strong support for having a flexible, open access, multimedia-enabled platform like Gala. Participants were invited to consider sharing their own "co-branded" case studies and to help guide the development of the platform.

Saturday discussion also explored what learning outcomes environment and sustainability cases are well suited for, and how our cases can not only bring together people together online but also facilitation face to face learning. The uniqueness of environment and sustainability cases compared to other cases: they tend to be more complex, place more emphasis on human aspects, and typically describe problems for which there is great uncertainty and no one right answer. Participants and MSC are going to co-create a sustainability learning summit every year to bring together stakeholders to supplement online learning.

The weekend wrapped up on Sunday with a field trip to Saginaw Forest, led by Sucila Fernandes of SEAS and Matt Naud of the City of Ann Arbor.  The forest is home to Third Sister Lake, the site where the contamination of Ann Arbor's groundwater with 1,4-dioxane was first recognized. Since its discovery several decades ago, the issue has dogged the city and the dilemma over how to clean up the pollution is now the subject of a Michigan Sustainability Case. The visit highlighted the potential for cases to capture the multiple dimensions of sustainability and environmental issues and interface with real world actors. A charette about the issue has been proposed to feature at the inaugural sustainability learning summit.

As participants returned home, we noted a shared vision of the potential for higher education and its educational innovations, such as cases, to drive forward progress on pressing societal and environmental issues. We look forward for a journey of strong partnership with shared visions toward ....
