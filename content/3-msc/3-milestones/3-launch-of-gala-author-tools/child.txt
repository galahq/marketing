----

Text:

MSC launched the Gala author tools at (link: ../galaxy-2018 text: Galaxy 2018). The tools allow anyone to post their case studies directly on (link: https://www.learngala.com/ text: Gala), embed media resources, and establish pre- and post quizzes for case deployment.

All new cases created will be automatically added to the (link: https://www.learngala.com/catalog/libraries/shared text: shared library) once the author decides to publish the case on Gala. Authors can also associate tags and topics with their cases. Further more, cases can be added to different branded libraries. Check out the new Gala homepage design with increased searchability.

Start posting your cases on Gala! Here are (link: https://docs.learngala.com/docs/authoring-getting-started.html text: some instructions) to help you get started.
